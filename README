First: special thanks to all of the creators that made these applications, I am but a humble docker merchant.

Second: I do not endorse using any of these applications for anything illegal or unethical (provided the work is unimportant/an ethical alternative exists, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)

If you have some extra cash please throw a donation at these creators, most of the applications have btcpay and liberapay addresses included at the bottom of the screen
