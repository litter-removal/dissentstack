	Welcome. Please read this entire section before you start writing.

	It is important for instance owners to provide a privacy policy so that
	their users understand what data is collected and how it is used.

	This is a Pug file. https://pugjs.org/ You can write any valid Pug here,
	but no variables are imported for you to use.

	If you are unfamiliar with Pug, you can also write HTML tags. You can mix
	Pug and HTML in this file.

	Get started by following these instructions:

	1. Copy this file from /src/site/pug/privacy.pug.template
	   to /src/site/pug/privacy.pug
	2. Edit this file to represent the actual privacy policy of your service.
	   You will likely need to delete or create entire sections of text.
	3. Open /config.js and add the pair `has_privacy_policy: true` to
	   mark your instance as having a privacy policy. The policy will be linked
	   on the homepage and a feature will be added to /api/stats.

	If you prefer to set your privacy policy through other software like nginx,
	you may just set the pair in config.js without following steps 1-2. Set up
	a rule for the URL `/privacy` to either serve a page or redirect somewhere.
	If you choose to do that, Bibliogram will not be able to apply meta tags
	or CSS to your page.

			section
				//-
					This data is collected by the Bibliogram software itself. It is
					likely the same for your instance, unless you have set
					special settings to change it.
				h2 Data collected by Bibliogram
				p.
					Bibliogram logs all incoming request URLs and the time of the request
					to the console, but does not log headers, IP addresses, or other
					information. These logs are not stored on disk.
				p.
					Bibliogram has a database that stores the usernames and IDs of
					viewed users, and all data about viewed posts. This data is not
					linked with the user that requested it.

			section
				//-
					This data is not collected by Bibliogram, and is specific to your
					server, and is entirely within your control.
					If you operate under a "no logs" policy, you can likely delete this
					entire section.
				h2 Data collected by nginx
				p.
					This server uses nginx as a reverse proxy to Bibliogram. nginx is
					configured to use the default logging settings, which means that this
					data is logged:
				ul
					li Request timestamp
					li Request URL
					li IP address
					li Reported user agent
					li Reported referrer
				p.
					These logs are saved to disk and stored indefinitely.

			section
				//-
					I sure hope you're not sending user data anywhere, but if you actually
					are, you'll need to change this section.
					If you use Google Analytics or similar software, you could write
					about it here.
				h2 Sending data
				p.
					Data collected by Bibliogram is not public and is never sent
					to any external services.

			section
				h2 Exporting or deleting your data
				p.
					Since Bibliogram does not associate any data with a user
					identifier, we cannot export or delete "your" data since we have
					no concept of "you".

			//-
				Remember that you can create or delete entire sections containing
				whatever content you want!
